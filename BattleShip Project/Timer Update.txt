There have been a couple of updates regarding timers in the BattleShip Gui

There have been two added stats to the stat board.
Average turn time
Total game time

Both of these stats work in conjunction with the new timer implemented in the program.

The added timer ticks every 1000 miliseconds (1 second). At every tick, the time updates the new turn timer progress bar.
The progress bar counts up to 30 seconds.
Once the 30 seconds limit is hit, the game either fires the current inputed target or the default A1.
This encourages the player to play the game and to be on their toes.

The timer pauses when viewing the stats screen as to not rush the stat gathering state.
